LAHORE: Putting  stout defence of the solar power projects, Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif has said his government has saved Rs2 billion by cutting the cost of Quaid-e-Azam Solar Power Park project.He said efforts were made to make the project controversial, adding that the government not only reduced the cost but also setup the project within six months.The chief minister said since his government believes in transparency, it plans to conduct the audit of the Nandipur Power project through an international company after facing the allegations of corruption.
